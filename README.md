# Jack Murphy CV

I am a hard-working full stack web developer. I studied Mathematics at university, and after graduating, taught maths for 3 years in a Vietnamese secondary school whilst living in Hanoi. I am highly adaptable and resourceful; since graduating I have set up and run both a small gardening business and tennis coaching programs. Now working as a developer, I particularly enjoy the problem solving aspect of coding and have loved working as part of a team at DWYL to build full stack web applications.  I have also enjoyed mentoring developers at the London based school Founders and Coders, and am very pleased with my work in mentoring and coordinating the first international iteration of the F&C course in Nazareth, Israel, aimed at getting Palestinians living in Israel into tech.

## RECENT PROJECTS

#### [Ellen MacArther Foundation CE100 app](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/sail-back)
**Hapi, Handlebars, Postgres, Redis**

Ideas and problem sharing platform designed for the members of the EMF CE100 scheme. This MVP was built in 6 sprints with one other developer with a strong emphasis on GitHub work flow.  One of the main challenges in this application came when we migrated our database from Redis to Postgres after moving it forward from the prototype stage. All Postgres functionality is extracted into several modules published on npm.



#### [Friends of Chichester Harbour](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/sail-back)
**Sails, MySQL, React, Redux, Ramda**

This project was written with a Sails.js backend and React/Redux front end. It is written using functional style with the assistance of Ramda.js and Sancturary.js.  The application is currently used in production and I am currently working as the lead developer on the project.

#### [HUB App](https://github.com/FAC7/anna-freud-hub)
**Hapi, ReactNative, Handlebars, Redis**.

HUB is a safe and secure place for NHS staff to post events specifically for past and current patients who have suffered from depression or anxiety. Admin interface built using handlebars.js and the end users front end was designed as a native mobile app built using React Native. Currently being tested.


#### [Reuse App](https://github.com/JMurphyWeb/onpurposehack)
